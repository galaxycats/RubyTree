=== 0.7.0 / 2010-05-03

* Added new methods to report the degree statistics of a node.

* Added a convenience method alias 'level' to 'nodeDepth'.

* Converted the exceptions thrown on invalid arguments to 'ArgumentError' instead of 'RuntimeError'.

* Converted the documentation to Yard format.

* Added new methods for converting from/to JSON formats.  Thanks to Dirk Breuer[http://github.com/railsbros-dirk] for
  this fork[http://github.com/galaxycats/].

* Added a separate API-CHANGES documentation file.

* Added fixes for root related edge conditions to 'isOnlyChild?', 'nextSibling', 'previousSibling' and 'remove' methods.

* Removed the 'ChangeLog' file as this can now be generated from the git logs.

* Other minor code cleanup.

=== 0.6.2 / 2010-01-30

* Updated the documentation.

=== 0.6.1 / 2010-01-04

* Changed the hard-dependency on the 'structured_warnings' RubyGem to a soft-dependency - which lets Rubytree still
  work if this RubyGem is not available.  The rationale for this is that we should not require the user to install a
  separate library just for one single edge-case function (in this case, to indicate a deprecated method).  However, if
  the library _is_ available on the user's system, then it will get used.

=== 0.6.0 / 2010-01-03

* Fixed the bug#22535[http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=22535&group_id=1215&atid=4793] where the
  depth method was actually returning height+1 (not the depth).

* Marked the Tree::TreeNode#depth method as *deprecated* (and introduced the run-time dependency on
  structured-warnings[http://github.com/schmidt/structured_warnings] gem).

=== 0.5.3 / 2009-12-31

* Cleanup of the build system to exclusively use Hoe.
* Modifications and reformatting to the documentation.
* No user visible changes.

=== 0.5.2 / 2007-12-21

  names.

=== 0.5.1 / 2007-12-20

* Minor code refactoring.

=== 0.5.0 / 2007-12-18
