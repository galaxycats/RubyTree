= API Changes in RubyTree

This file documents various API level changes that have been made to the RubyTree package.

Note: API level changes are expected to reduce dramatically after the 1.x release.  In most cases, an alternative will
be provided to ensure relatively smooth transition to the new APIs.

== Release 0.8.0 Changes

- Added the ability to specify an optional insertion position in the {Tree::TreeNode#add} method.  Idea and original
  code contributed by Dirk.

== Release 0.7.0 Changes

- Converted all exceptions thrown on invalid method arguments to from 'RuntimeError' to 'ArgumentError'.  This impacts the
  following methods:

  - {Tree::TreeNode#initialize}
  - {Tree::TreeNode#add}
  - {Tree::TreeNode#[]}
  - {Tree::BinaryTreeNode#add}

- Added {Tree::TreeNode#level} as an alias for {Tree::TreeNode#nodeDepth}

- Added new methods {Tree::TreeNode#in_degree} and {Tree::TreeNode#out_degree} to report the node's degree stats

- {Tree::TreeNode#isOnlyChild?} now returns +true+ for a root node.

- {Tree::TreeNode#nextSibling} and {Tree::TreeNode#previousSibling} now return +nil+ for a root node.

- {Tree::TreeNode#add} and {Tree::TreeNode#<<} now throw an ArgumentError exception if a +nil+ node is passed as an argument.

- Added new methods {Tree::TreeNode#to_json} and {Tree::TreeNode::json_create} to convert to/from the JSON format.
  Thanks to Dirk[http://github.com/railsbros-dirk] for this change.

== Release 0.6.1 Changes

- Deprecated the {Tree::TreeNode#depth} method as it was returning an incorrect depth value.  Have introduced a new replacement
  method {Tree::TreeNode#nodeDepth} which returns the correct result.
